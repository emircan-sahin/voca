        "Every plan starts with a 3-day free trial — fully featured, no restrictions. Pick any plan, try it risk-free, and cancel anytime.",
        "After the trial, plans start at just $3/month. No hidden fees, no surprise charges. What you see is what you pay.",
        "Unlike competitors who charge ~$8/month plus extra API key costs, Voca includes everything in one simple subscription."
      ]

    {
      "question": "Can I cancel anytime?",
      "answer": [
        "Yes. Cancel whenever you want — your current period stays active, and the next month simply won't renew.",
        "No cancellation fees, no hidden terms, no awkward retention flows. One click and you're done.",
        "Everything is open source. You can verify our billing, our code, and our promises — nothing is hidden."

      "question": "What makes Voca different?",
      "answer": [
        "Background noise cancellation built for real-world environments — especially useful for developers in noisy spaces.",
        "AI that recognizes function names, code terms, and technical jargon, then transcribes them correctly instead of guessing.",
        "Smart auto-paste: the corrected transcript lands right where your cursor was. No copy-paste, no switching apps.",

    {
      "question": "What is Developer Mode?",
      "answer": [
        "Developer Mode is a tone setting built specifically for software engineers. When enabled, Voca's AI recognizes code terms, function names, library names, and technical jargon — and transcribes them correctly instead of treating them as regular words.",
        "Say \"reakt use state hook\" and it writes \"React useState hook\". Say \"nahbar component\" and it writes \"navbar component\".",
        "Combined with background noise cancellation, it's designed for developers who dictate code comments, documentation, or messages while working in real-world environments."
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Which languages are supported?",
      "answer": [

        "100+ languages for AI-powered translation with tone control — formal, casual, or developer mode.",

        "If you don't want anything stored on our servers, simply toggle it off in Settings. Your recordings and transcripts won't be saved — it's entirely your choice.",
